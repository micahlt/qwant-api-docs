## About
Qwant is a European-owned search engine that has a **free** and **limitless** API that returns items as JSON, making it optimal for JavaScript developers.  However, though open to use, the API is closed-source and fully undocumented.  This repository houses the endpoints I've discovered and tested around the Internet.  _All of the following endpoints begin with the url [`https://api.qwant.com/api`](https://api.qwant.com/api)._  Keep in mind, the Qwant API is protected by CORS policy, meaning you'll need a proxy in order to interact directly with it on the Internet (not on a server or computer).
