## About
Qwant is a European-owned search engine that has a **free** and **limitless** API that returns items as JSON, making it optimal for JavaScript developers.  However, though open to use, the API is closed-source and fully undocumented.  This repository houses the endpoints I've discovered and tested around the Internet.  _All of the following endpoints begin with the url `https://api.qwant.com/api`._

## Endpoints
### [`GET /search`](search.md)
### [`GET /suggest`](suggest.md)
